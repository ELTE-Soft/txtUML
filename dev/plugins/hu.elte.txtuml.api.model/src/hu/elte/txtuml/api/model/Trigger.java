/**
 * A runtime annotation to define the trigger of a transition.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Represents:</b> trigger of a transition
 * <p>
 * <b>Usage:</b>
 * <p>
 * 
 * Use on a subclass of {@link hu.elte.txtuml.api.model.StateMachine.Transition
 * Transition} and set the value of the {@link #value() value} element to
 * reference the representing class of the desired signal (as a signal event).
 * The current implementation does not support any other kind of events on
 * triggers.
 * <p>
 * Only one trigger might be applied to a transition.
 * <p>
 * Transitions are only allowed to have no triggers if they are from an initial
 * pseudostate or a choice pseudostate. Therefore, transitions not included in
 * these two cases must have exactly one trigger defined.
 * <p>
 * It is also possible to restrict the trigger to only accept signals that
 * appear on a specific port. For this, set a value to the {@link Trigger#port()
 * port} element.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Example:</b>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * {@literal @From(SourceState.class) @To(TargetState.class) @Trigger(SampleSignal.class)}
 * class SampleTransition extends Transition {}
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 * 
 * See the documentation of {@link StateMachine} for detailed examples.
 * <p>
 * See the documentation of {@link Model} for an overview on modeling in
 * JtxtUML.
