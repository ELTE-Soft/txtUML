/**
 * A model executor thread is used by a model executor to run a model or parts
 * of a model (the executor may use multiple threads). Every
 * {@link hu.elte.txtuml.api.model.ModelClass} and
 * {@link hu.elte.txtuml.api.model.ModelClass.Port} instance is owned by one
 * model executor thread which runs and manages that instance. Whenever an
 * asynchronous event is raised (for example, a signal is sent to such an
 * instance), it is reported to the owner thread, which puts that event into its
 * mailbox and later processes it. The processing of one such event is called a
 * model execution step, which is also an iteration of the main loop of a model
 * executor thread. This thread stops if:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Either
 * <ul>
 * <li>the model executor to which this thread belongs has been forced to shut
 * down immediately,</li>
 * <li>or the model executor has no termination blockers (which implies that its
 * graceful shutdown procedure has been started) <b>and</b> this thread's
 * mailbox is empty,</li>
 * <li>or {@link #earlyStop} returns true (is false by default).</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>The {@link AbstractModelExecutor#unregisterThread(ModelExecutorThread)}
 * method returns true.</li>
 * </ol>
 * Otherwise, the loop tries to continue working, even if it has been
 * interrupted while waiting for new events.
