 *         Sequence diagram execution implementation package. Main goal of this
 *         package is to provide an execution interface for sequence diagrams of
 *         models. These diagrams can be used to test the models validity or in
 *         other terms to create test cases for the models.
 *         </p>
 *         <p>
 *         Only basic elements are supported so far. These elements are:
 *         Sequential and alternative fragments,synchronized messages and
 *         lifelines
 *         </p>
