 * Represent the composite relation between the {@link World} instance in the current

 * is automatically linked to the world.

 * The {@link WorldOwnsObject.objects} end of this composition is hidden,
 * use the {@link World#getObject} method instead.
 * <p>
 * Note that despite this composition is automatically linked between the world
 * and newly created world objects, it is never used by the <i>txtUML World</i> model. This means
 * that linking and unlinking this composition has no effect on the services of the
 * <i>txtUML World</i> model.
 * <p>
 * See the documentation of the {@link hu.elte.txtuml.api.stdlib.world}
 * package or further details and examples about the services provided by
 * the <i>txtUML World</i> model.
 * <p>
 * See the documentation of {@link hu.elte.txtuml.api.model.Model} for an
 * overview on modeling in JtxtUML.
